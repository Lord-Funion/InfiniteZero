<p>
  The DMCA will one day try to attack our instances of P-NP.
  This will likely cause us to private our GitHub repositories sometimes, and take down our P-NP.
  I refer to that, as that day zero.
  And Infinite is what I call the infinite lifespan of Prodigy Hacks, due to my idea.

<p>There isn't a way to stop this, but I know exactly what to do.</p>
